## Description
This app allows you to create a team portfolio webstie based on the information a you input of your team.

 -I built this project in order to create a quick portfolio website for the different teams I work with.

 -This solves the problem of needing to make a new team portfolio from scratch everytime you need to make one.<

 -With this project I learned how to link data to parts of an html template in order to create team member cards that reflect user input.
